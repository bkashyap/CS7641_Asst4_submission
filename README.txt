Assignment 4: Markov Decision Processes

Link to code and data https://github.com/bkashyap/CS7641_Asst4_submission

All analysis is done in Jupyter IPython Notebooks you should be able to see the charts and code by just opening the files in github. Here are the direct links:
1. All Charts used for Analysis - https://github.com/bkashyap/CS7641_Asst4_submission/blob/master/Assignment4.ipynb
2. All Experimentation Done with additional Charts and results - https://github.com/bkashyap/CS7641_Asst4_submission/blob/master/Assignment4Additional.ipynb


How to run Instructions

Instructions for running Jupyter Notebooks for analysis of both Discrete Optimization and Neural Network Sections:
1. Sync code from github repository from https://github.com/bkashyap/CS7641_Asst4_submission
2. requirements.txt contains all dependencies (The major ones are pandas, numpy, jupyter, seaborn, matplotlib, mdptoolbox-hiive). Create Python3 environment using requirements.txt by running "pip3 install -r requirements.txt" while inside project directory
3. Open localhost:8888 on your browser and navigate and open Assignment4.ipynb, Assignment4Additional.ipynb
4. If you need to run the code you can run individual code blocks by pressing shift + enter
